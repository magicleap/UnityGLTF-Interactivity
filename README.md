# GLTF Interactivity

Package for supporting the Interactivity extension for GLTFs. Built on top of UnityGLTF.

Currently focused on playing back interactive GLTFs at runtime. Future work may include runtime authoring/export to allow for editors to be made.

> [!WARNING]
> **This project is a work in progress as we finish supporting every node and pointer available in the current GLTF Interactivity Spec.**

## Testing GLBs
To test out an interactive GLB in this repo, place it in the *StreamingAssets* folder and change the **Model Name** you would like to load in the **Test** GameObject.
